A simple server-side ONLY app, to store and retrieve users from mongo db. Simplified User model.

* add git ignore
* gitinit and init commit
* npm init --yes
* what technologies? (express, mongoose, body-parser etc?).
* npm install these:

```
npm install body-parser mongoose express --save
```
* build up our server quick.
* connection string
* build the model
* require the model in the server file
* add a dummy get route
* add find routes
* add create
* add delete
